  <dc:description>Five European populations of the Cerastoderma glaucum/C. lamarcki complex were studied to elucidate differences between Mediterranean, Western European and Baltic populations: one from the French Mediterranean; two from the west coast of France; one from the Limfjord, Denmark; and one from the metal contaminated Gdansk Bay, Poland. The biochemical tissue composition related to five reproductive stages was analysed, and the results for the five populations were compared. The comparison showed that at similar maturity stages the biochemical composition of the cockle tissue was different for populations from each of the three regions, Northern Europe (region I), the French West coast (region II), and the Western Mediterranean (region III). These differences may reflect individual acclimation to different habitat conditions, as well as genetically-based adaptation at population or subspecies level.</dc:description>
