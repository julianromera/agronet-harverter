  <dc:description>One of the most promising alternatives to toxic heavy metal-based paints is offered by the development of antifouling coatings in which the active ingredients are compounds naturally occurring in marine organisms and operating as natural antisettlement agents. Sessile marine macroalgae are remarkably free from settlement by fouling organisms. They produce a wide variety of chemically active metabolites in their surroundings, potentially as an aid to protect themselves against other settling organisms. In this study, a dichloromethane extract from the brown seaweed Sargassum muticum was tested in situ and, after 2 months of immersion, showed less fouling organisms on paints in which the extract was included, compared to paints containing only copper after 2 months of immersion. No barnacles or mussels have been observed on the test rack. Identification by NMR and GC/MS of the effective compound revealed the abundance of palmitic acid, a commonly found fatty acid. Pure palmitic acid showed antibacterial activity at 44 A mu g mL(-1), and also inhibited the growth of the diatom Cylindrotheca closterium at low concentration (EC50 = 45.5 A mu g mL(-1)), and the germination of Ulva lactuca spores at 3 A mu g mL(-1). No cytotoxicity was highlighted, which is promising in the aim of the development of an environmentally friendly antifouling paint.</dc:description>
