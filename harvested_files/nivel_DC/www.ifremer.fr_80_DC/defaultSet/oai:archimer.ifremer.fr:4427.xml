  <dc:title>Reared broodstock of Penaeus monodon</dc:title>
  <dc:creator>AQUACOP</dc:creator>
  <dc:description>Since 1975, maturation and spawning in captivity of Penaeus monodon has been achieved in the 'Centre Oc√©anologique du Pacifique', a CNEXO Centre in Tahiti. The five first animals have been imported from Fiji Islands and in May 1979, four generations-have been obtained. Under the rearing conditions followed at the Centre, reproduction is achieved all throughout the year. Maturation is induced by unilateral eyestalk ablation on pond reared animals maintained in tanks on adequate food. Results concern mating behaviour, ovarian development, number of spawnings per female and egg viability. The rearing and the maintenance conditions of the captive broodstocks are particularly important to obtain reliable results necessary to sustain commercial hatcheries. Mass production of postlarvae is routinely achieved. [NOT CONTROLLED OCR]</dc:description>
