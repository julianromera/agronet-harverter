  <dc:description>(Not controled OCR )The author describes the French fishing fleet replacement policy from 1945 to 1983 and ascertains from it the objectives and constraints of public policy. While the theoretical and practical negative effects of open-access fisheries were well assessed, the French experience provides an example of the difficulties of carrying out a policy limiting access to fisheries. Domestic conflicts of interest and open competition with foreign countries failed to limit the overall fishing capacity of the French fleet. They have also led the government to focus on shortterm distributional issues rather than on long-term efficiency. It is the author's opinion that similar case studies could be useful for understanding the evolution of the fishing sector as well as for putting into perspective the results of the theoretical literature on open-access fisheries.</dc:description>
