  <dc:description>Ocean surface mixing and drift are influenced by the mixed layer depth, buoyancy fluxes and currents below the mixed layer. Drift and mixing are also functions of the surface Stokes drift U, volume Stokes transport T-s, a wave breaking height scale H-swg, and the flux of energy from waves to ocean turbulence Phi(oc). Here we describe a global database of these parameters, estimated from a well-validated numerical wave model, that uses traditional forms of the wave generation and dissipation parameterizations, and covers the years 2003-2007. Compared to previous studies, the present work has the advantage of being consistent with the known physical processes that regulate the wave field and the air-sea fluxes, and also consistent with a very large number of in situ and satellite observations of wave parameters. Consequently, some of our estimates differ significantly from previous estimates. In particular, we find that the mean global integral of Phi(oc) is 68 TW, and the yearly mean value of T-s is typically 10-30% of the Ekman transport, except in well-defined regions where it can reach 60%. We also have refined our previous estimates of U-ss by using a better treatment of the high frequency part of the wave spectrum. In the open ocean, U-ss similar or equal to 0.013U(10), where U-10 is the wind speed at 10 m height. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</dc:description>
