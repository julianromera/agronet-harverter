  <dc:description>This paper describes the quantitative relationships between phytoplankton abundance and species number, dominance and niche breadth during ''bloom'' and ''non-bloom'' stages in a coastal marine environment of the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. Analysis of the relative frequency distribution of the species breadth per sample showed each assemblage to be a mixture of species with narrow (&lt; 3), moderate (4-8) and broad (&gt; 8) niche breadth. Assemblages with higher (&gt; 30) numbers of species tended to have a greater proportion (up to 25-30 %) of species with narrow breadth in relation to the samples with fewer taxa. In ''bloom'' assemblages, the total cell abundance increased above the concentration level of ''non-bloom'' assemblages (baseline population) by two-three class orders, 75.5-78.9 % of this increase being due to the first dominant species, 5.3-8.5 % to the second dominant and the remainder to all the other species. All dominant species exhibited moderate (5.91-7.94) breadth values. On the basis of the species niche breadth and their abundance the phytoplankton community-unit could be divided into certain levels or scales of hierarchy, i.e. a background population formed by broad breadth-low abundance species; a population with species demonstrating moderate breadth and high abundance (including dominants); and a population characterized by narrow breadth-low abundance (rare) species.</dc:description>
