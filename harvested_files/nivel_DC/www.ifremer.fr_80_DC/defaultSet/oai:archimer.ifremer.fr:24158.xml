  <dc:description>The Fe-Mn oxide fraction leached from deep-sea sediments has been increasingly used to reconstruct the Nd isotope composition of deep water masses, that can be used to track changes in oceanic circulation with a high temporal resolution. Application of this archive to reconstruct the Nd isotope composition of bottom seawater in shallow shelf environments remained however to be tested. Yet as the Nd isotope composition of seawater on continental margins is particularly sensitive to changes in erosional inputs, establishment of neritic seawater Nd isotope evolution around areas of deep water formation would be useful to discriminate the influence of changes in oceanic circulation and in isotopic composition of erosional inputs on the Nd isotope record of deep waters. The purpose of this study is to test the potential of Fe-Mn coatings leached from foraminifera tests to reconstruct the Nd isotope composition of seawater in shelf environments for deep-time intervals. Albian to Turonian samples from two different outcrops have been recovered, from the Paris Basin (Wissant section, northern France) and from the Western Interior Seaway (Hot Spring, South Dakota, USA), that were deposited in epicontinental seas. Rare Earth Element (REE) spectra enriched in middle REEs in the foraminifera leach at Wissant highlight the presence of Fe-Mn oxides. The similarity of the Nd isotopic signal of the Fe-Mn oxide fraction leached from foraminifera tests with that of fish teeth suggests that Fe-Mn oxides coating foraminifera can be good archives of shelf bottom seawater Nd isotopic composition. Inferred bottom shelf water Nd isotope compositions at Wissant range from -8.5 to -9.7 epsilon-units, about 1.5-2 epsilon-units higher than that of the contemporaneous local detrital fraction. At Hot Spring, linear REE spectra characterizing foraminifera leach may point to an absence of authigenic marine Fe-Mn oxide formation in this area during the Late Cenomanian-Early Turonian, consistent with dysoxic to anoxic conditions at Hot Spring, contemporaneous to an Oceanic Anoxic Event. The similarity of the Nd isotopic signal of the carbonate matrix of foraminifera with that of fish teeth suggests that it records the Nd isotope composition of bottom shelf seawater as well. Inferred bottom shelf water Nd isotope compositions at Hot Spring are quite radiogenic, between -7 and -6 epsilon-units, about 2.5-4 epsilon-units higher than that of the contemporaneous local detrital fraction. In contrast, in both sections Fe-Mn oxides leached directly from the decarbonated sediment tend to yield a less radiogenic Nd isotopic composition, typically between 0.2 and 0.8 epsilon-units lower, that is intermediate between that of fish teeth and of the detrital fraction. This suggests the contribution of pre-formed continental Fe-Mn oxides to the Nd isotopic signal, along with authigenic marine oxides, or a detrital contamination during leaching.
