  <dc:description>Penaeidins are members of a new family of antimicrobial peptides isolated from a crustacean, which present both Gram-positive antibacterial and antifungal activities. We have studied the localization of synthesis and storage of penaeidins in the shrimp Penaeus vannamei. The distribution of penaeidin transcripts and peptides in various tissues reveals that penaeidins are constitutively synthesized and stored in the shrimp haemocytes. It was shown by immunocytochemistry, at both optical and ultrastructural levels, that the peptides are localized in granulocyte cytoplasmic granules, The expression and localization of penaeidins were further analysed in shrimp subjected to microbial challenge. We found that (1) penaeidin mRNA levels decrease in circulating haemocytes in the first 3 hours following stimulation and (2) an increase in plasma penaeidin concentration occurs after microbial challenge, together with (3) a penaeidin immunoreactivity in cuticular tissue, which can be related to the chitin-binding activity we demonstrate here for penaeidins.</dc:description>
