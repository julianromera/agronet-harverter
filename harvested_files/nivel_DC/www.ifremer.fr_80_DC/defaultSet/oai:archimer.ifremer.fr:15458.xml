  <dc:description>NOAA’s National Marine Fisheries Services (NMFS) received a petition to list the Eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) as either threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The Eastern oyster is an emblematic species in the US coastal states, playing a significant role at various levels: shaping coastal social communities, providing a commercial activity (public fishery &amp; aquaculture) and recreational - amenity benefits, and as a keystone species in highly diverse and sensitive ecosystems (estuaries). This petition is likely the result of concerns regarding the partial collapse of public fisheries in several states as well as from the resulting damages to this species induced by severe hurricanes. A Biological Review Team (BRT) was convened to review the status of the Eastern oyster and produced a final report entitled ‘Status of the Eastern Oyster Crassostrea virginica’. This work has been reviewed to provide further and complementary recommendations.</dc:description>
