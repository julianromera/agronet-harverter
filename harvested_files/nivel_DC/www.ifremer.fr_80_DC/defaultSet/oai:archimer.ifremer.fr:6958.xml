  <dc:description>A study was conducted to evaluate the effect of two dietary carbohydrate sources (waxy maize starch and glucose) on the metabolic adaptation of sea bass juveniles (initial weight: 24 g) to a heat shock treatment (temperature rise from 18 degrees C to 25 degrees C within 24 h). Two isonitrogenous and isolipidic diets were fon-nulated to contain 20% waxy maize starch (WS diet) or 20% glucose (GLU diet). Triplicate groups of fish were fed to near satiation for 4 weeks at both temperatures (18 degrees C and 25 degrees C). Then, fish previously maintained at 18 degrees C were submitted to a heat shock (18 degrees C to 25 degrees C) and continued to be fed with the same diets during I more week. The higher water temperature significantly improved growth performance, feed efficiency, as well as protein efficiency ratio, independently of diet. At 25 degrees C, but not at 18 degrees C, growth of fish fed the WS diet was higher than that of fish fed the GLU diet. Plasma glucose levels were higher in sea bass fed the GLU diet and not influenced by water temperature. Fish fed a glucose diet or reared at high temperatures (25 degrees C) showed enhanced liver glycolytic, lipogenic and gluconeogenic capacities compared to fish fed a starch diet or reared at low temperatures (18 degrees C). For the majority of the enzymes studied, I week seemed to be enough time for metabolic adaptation in sea bass submitted to an acute heat shock. 

Irrespective of carbohydrate source, HSP70 gene expression was similar in both cold water (18 degrees C) and warm water (25 degrees C) acclimated sea bass. A weak down regulation was observed after heat shock only in fish fed the GLU diet. This suggests that HSP70 gene expression is not affected by the rearing temperature per se. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
