  <dc:description>Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are generally considered as one of the most important tools, among the many regulations, designed to preserve marine resources as well as enhance fisheries. In the southern Bay of Biscay, local French fishermen requested creation of a restricted area to help settle disputes between the various métiers operating there. This restricted area, which lies mainly in French waters, covers part of a deep submarine canyon off the French and Spanish coasts, known to have a large population of mature hake. This study aims to better understand the effects of a restricted area upon French fleets operating there, particularly upon three main métiers – longliners, gillnetters and trawlers. The study area includes three ICES statistical rectangles. The data, based upon reported landings and auctions sales for the period 1985 – 2008, were analyzed using multivariate analysis. The fishing activity is more important in one rectangle which includes the restricted area. Bottom longliners and gillnetters, operate mainly in this one while trawlers are less dependent. The first métier concentrates particularly on hake and the second has targeted other species and has become less dependent on hake. Trawlers target a wider range of species. Over the past ten years, the restricted area has contributed to maintain the fleets operating here. The border with Spain adds other constraints over the issue of access to regional fisheries and makes management a little more complicated.</dc:description>
