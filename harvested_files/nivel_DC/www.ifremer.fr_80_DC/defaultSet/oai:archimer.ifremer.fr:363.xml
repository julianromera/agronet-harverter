  <dc:description>A novel, thermophilic, anaerobic bacterium that is able to tolerate hydrogen was isolated from a deep-sea hydrothermal chimney collected at the Rainbow field on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Cells were rod-shaped and surrounded by a sheath-like outer structure (toga); they were weakly motile by means of a polar flagellum. They appeared singly, in pairs or in short chains. They grew at 35-65 degrees C (optimum 60 degrees C), pH 4.5-8.5 (optimum pH 6.0) and 10-65 g sea salts l(-1) (optimum 30-40 g l(-1)). The isolate was organotrophic, and able to grow on various carbohydrates or complex proteinaceous substrates. Growth was not inhibited under 100% hydrogen or in the presence of 2% oxygen in the gas phase. The isolate reduces sulfur, although sulfur reduction is not required for growth. The fermentation products identified on glucose were acetate, ethanol, formate, hydrogen and CO2. The G + C content of the genomic DNA was 28 +/- 1 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene placed the strain within the genus Marinitoga, order Thermotogales, in the bacterial domain. On the basis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons and physiological characteristics, the isolate is considered to represent a novel species, for which the name Marinitoga hydrogenitolerans sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is AT1271(T) (=DSM 16785(T) = JCM 12826(T)).</dc:description>
