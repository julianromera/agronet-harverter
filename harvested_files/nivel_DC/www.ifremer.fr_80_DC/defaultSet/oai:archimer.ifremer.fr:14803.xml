  <dc:description>Analysing investment drivers in fisheries is essential in understanding the long-term development of fishing capacity. This paper addresses the drivers of investment in the French commercial fishing fleets operating along the Atlantic coast, and the role of public policies have had on investment. First, we examine the changes in the capital value of the fleet, which was strongly impacted by decommissioning schemes during the nineties. We then examine drivers of investment using an unbalanced panel data set describing the investment decisions of a sample of firms over the period 1994-2004. In addition to economic variables, the estimated models account for other factors that may have an impact on investment behaviour, including the different career phases of the skipper-owners. The study concludes with a discussion of the results, and in particular of the role of fiscal policy on observed investment strategies. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</dc:description>
