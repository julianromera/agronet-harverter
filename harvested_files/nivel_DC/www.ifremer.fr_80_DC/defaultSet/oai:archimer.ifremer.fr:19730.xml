  <dc:description>Generalised Linear Models, combined with a Geographic Information System, were used to map the habitats of ten demersal elasmobranch taxa (five skates, four sharks and a stingray) in the eastern English Channel, based on an annual fishery-independent bottom trawl survey conducted each October, and covering 21 years. Habitat models showing mean density levels were developed for the most frequently occurring species, whilst binomial occurrence habitat models were built for less frequent species. The main predictors of elasmobranch habitats in the eastern English Channel were depth, bed shear stress and salinity, followed by seabed sediment type and temperature. Habitat maps highlighted contrasting habitat utilisation across species. Raja clavata, and to a lesser extent Scyliorhinus canicula, showed ontogenetic differences in habitat utilisation, with early life history stages found in shallow coastal waters, sheltered from strong tidal currents and typically with softer sediments. Spatial segregation by sex was also evident for S. canicula, with females found at higher densities on some harder grounds in the study area. An improved knowledge of habitat utilisation by elasmobranchs (particularly for important life history stages and all seasons) is required if spatial management is to be considered for these species.
