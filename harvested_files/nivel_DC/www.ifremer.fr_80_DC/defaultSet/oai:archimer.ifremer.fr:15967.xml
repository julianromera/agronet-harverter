  <dc:description>Brominated flame retardants (BFRs) were investigated in juvenile common sole from nursery zones situated along the French coast in 2007, 2008 and 2009. Extensive identification was performed with regard to PBDEs, novel BFRs 1.2-bis(2,4,6-tribromophenoxy)ethane (BTBPE) and decabromodiphenylethane (DBDPE), and other non-PBDE BFRs, namely, hexabromobenzene (HBB) and 2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexabromobiphenyl (BB-153). Polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) concentrations (E 14 congeners) ranged from 0.01 ng/g to 0.16 ng/g wet weight (ww) in muscle, and 0.07 ng/g to 2.8 ng/g ww in liver. Concentrations were in the lower range of those reported in the literature in other European locations. Lower PBDE concentrations, condition indices and lipid contents were observed in the Seine estuary in 2009, possibly in relation to a lower water flow. The PBDE patterns and ratios we observed suggested that juvenile sole have a relative high metabolic degradation capacity. Non-PBDE BFRs were detected at lower levels than PBDEs, i.e., within the &lt; method detection limit - 0.005 ng/g ww range in muscle, and &lt; method detection limit - 0.2 ng/g ww range in liver. The data obtained is of particular interest for the future monitoring of these compounds in the environment. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</dc:description>
