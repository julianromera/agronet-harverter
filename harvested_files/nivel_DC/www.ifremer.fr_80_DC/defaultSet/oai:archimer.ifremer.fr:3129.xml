  <dc:description>If rays are traditionally fished for their caudal fins, the rest of the body is wasted, except part of the skin that can be transformed into leather. Liver oil of the ray, Himantura bleekeri, was characterized in terms of lipid class composition and fatty acid profile. Liver oil content was high and represented 54% of the liver weight (w/w). Neutral lipids were predominant (92%), major components being triacylglycerols (63%). Other neutral lipids identified were hydrocarbons, sterol esters, mono- and di-acylglycerols, free fatty acids, sterols and glyceryl ethers. Polyunsaturated fatty acids of the n-3 series, namely eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids, were high (4% and 16%, respectively). Cholesterol was the major component in the sterol fractions (free or esterified). Hydrocarbons were up to 30 carbons and squalene was present at the level of 22%. Thus, this liver oil proved to be an adequate source of n-3 fatty acids and other valuable lipidic compounds. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</dc:description>
