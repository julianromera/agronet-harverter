  <dc:description>Estuaries and coastal areas are often subjected to much pollution, including pesticides and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) produced by anthropic activities. Bay of Marennes-Oléron is an estuarine coastal zone in which there is a high level of aquacultural production and this has adverse effects in aquatic organisms. In fact, PAHs, which are widely spread throughout aquatic ecosystems, have a low polarity and so there is a clear tendency to bioaccumulate in marine organisms (1). The harmful effects of such contaminants on the organism's immune system, leading to a decreased resistance to pathogens, is a relatively new area of research and it still poorly understood. 
The aim of the present work was to detect the impact in vivo of PAHs on the immune system of the sea bass, Dicentrarchus labrax.</dc:description>
