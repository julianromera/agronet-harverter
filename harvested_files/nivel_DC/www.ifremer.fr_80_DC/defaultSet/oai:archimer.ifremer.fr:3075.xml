  <dc:description>Artificial media are used in physiological studies of microalgae to maintain consistent conditions from one experiment to another and these media must be adapted to the needs of the organism studied. The artificial medium, in this case named diatom artificial medium (DAM), was designed to maintain long-term cultures of Haslea ostrearia and 19 other planktonic microalgae, and to allow physiological studies related to metal metabolism. The biomass and biochemical composition of H. ostrearia grown in the DAM and in a modified Provasoli medium were compared to assess the suitability of this new artificial medium for the culture of this diatom. The DAM provided sufficient nutrients to allow H. ostrearia to grow as efficiently as in the enriched seawater medium, without negative impact on metabolism. The DAM was tested with 19 other microalgae in order to widen its potential use, and 18 of the 19 showed a good adaptation to this medium. The chemical speciation of metals (Cd, Cu, Pb, Zn) was assessed using a speciation mathematical model. The presence of EDTA resulted in the total complexation of the trace metals implying that they were present in a sole chemical species in the DAM.</dc:description>
