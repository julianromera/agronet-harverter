  <dc:description>Two diets based oil fish meal (FM) or oil a mixture of plant protein sources supplemented with free amino acids (PP) were fed to rainbow trout having a mean initial body weight of 162.5 g reared at 17 +/- 1 degreesC for 24 weeks to evaluate the effect of plant protein sources oil fish growth, morphological and body quality traits. At the end of the growth study, samples were withdrawn for chemical analyses as well as measurements of different parameters of quality. 

Compared to the FM group, the trout fed diet PP had lower growth rates (mean final body weight 663 vs. 800 g), feed efficiency (0.95 vs. 1.07) and protein efficiency ratio (1.96 vs. 2.13). Trout fed diet PP were also characterised by a lower dressed weight (89.45% vs. 91.07%), hepato-somatic index (0.92% vs. 1.01%) and fillet lipid content (5.50% vs. 6.98%), but had a higher mesenteric fat (5.65% vs. 4.08%), viscero-somatic index (10.55% vs. 8.93%) and fillet crude protein content (20.53% vs. 19.93%). The muscle fatty acid composition reflected that of the diet with a higher level of polyunsaturated (n-6) fatty acids in trout fed diet PP and a higher content in polyunsaturated n-3 fatty acids and n-3/n-6 ratio in trout fed diet FM. Sensory analysis was carried out at 5 days post-mortem on microwave-cooked dorsal portions of fillets stored at 1 degreesC with ice covering. The results of the triangular test showed differences between groups (P&lt;0.01) in organoleptic characteristics as well as in visual colour. Descriptive tests pointed out that fillets of trout fed diet PP exhibited higher hardness, less sweetness and less odour intensity than trout fed diet FM. 

In summary, data show that long-term feeding a diet in which fish meal was totally replaced by a mixture of plant protein sources significantly affects growth and quality criteria such as morphometric traits, fat deposits, fillet chemical composition and organoleptic characteristics of large commercial size rainbow trout.</dc:description>
