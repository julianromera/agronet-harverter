  <dc:description>In addition to the two new hydrothermal fields Krasnov (l6 degrees 38' N) and Ashadze (13 degrees N) discovered in 2003-2004, some later discoveries were made in the Northern Equatorial segment of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR). Two new major seafloor massive sulfide (SMS) deposits: Semyenov (13 degrees 31' N) and Zenith-Victory (20 degrees 08' N), as well as the now extended Puy des Folles hydrothermal field (20 degrees 30.5' N), provide enough data to make conclusions about the general characteristics of SMS deposits in the northern equatorial MAR environment. Parameters of SMS deposits, such as their distribution, geological setting, morphology, composition and age, are discussed in this paper. A majority of studied SMS deposits (Ashadze, Logatchev, Semyenov) are associated with uplifted lower crust and mantle rocks (oceanic core complex, or OCC) at the MAR segments with asymmetric mode of accretion. OCC is tectonically uplifted along with detachment faults, which exhume deep-seated rocks onto the seafloor. Detachment faults, in turn, could be the conduits for the circulation of seawater and discharge of hydrothermal fluids. Gabbro-peridotite hosted deposits are characterized by high concentrations of copper, gold and cobalt. The relationship between the size of the deposits and their age is documented.</dc:description>
