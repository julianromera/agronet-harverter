  <dc:description>One outcome of contemporary climate trends is that the involvement of hypoxia and heat tolerance in determining individual fitness will increase in many fish populations. Large fish are believed to be more tolerant to hypoxia than small fish (Nilsson and Ostlund-Nilsson, 2008) whereas thermal sensitivity is thought to decrease with body size (Clark et al., 2008). To better understand the bases of inter-individual variation in environmental adaptation performance, the current study examined hypoxia and heat tolerance in a fast growing (FGS; 288.3 +/- 14.4 g, 26.04 +/- 0.49 cm) and a slow growing (SGS; 119.95 +/- 6.41 g; 20.98 +/- 0.41 cm) strain of 1-year old rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). This examination was conducted using two standardized challenge tests aimed at assessing individual incipient lethal oxygen saturation and incipient upper lethal temperature. Results to these tests were then cross-correlated with swim tests during which individual basal and active metabolic rate values were also measured. Measurements of permeabilized ventricular myofibers oxygen consumption were also conducted, as well as various organ-to-body-mass ratios. Experimental data showed that FGS was more hypoxia tolerant than SGS (13.4 to 16.7% air sat versus 14.7 to 18.9% air sat respectively). On the other hand, FGS was found less tolerant to heat than SGS (24.7-27.6 degrees C versus 28.5 to 29.7 degrees C respectively). Adding to the body size effect, another source of inter-individual variation in environmental tolerance was found. Residual analysis highlighted that whereas none of the individual morphometric and energetic traits correlated with hypoxia tolerance, permeabilized ventricular myofibers maximal oxygen consumption correlated well with individual tolerance to heat.
