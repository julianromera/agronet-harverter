  <dc:description>The larval phase is a crucial period in the life of marine fish. During this phase, the organism will acquire the phenotype of an adult fish through the development of tissues and organs and the maturation of some of the principal physiological functions. Many biological processes (differentiation, cellular proliferation, growth, etc.) are regulated during this period. These regulations take place at different biological levels and particularly concern the expression of genes involved in larval ontogenesis processes. The development of bioinformatic resources (DNA or cDNA sequences) and molecular tools enabling high throughput gene expression analysis (microarrays) have allowed the transcriptome of marine fish species to be studied. In the present review, we summarize the main findings from transcriptomic investigations of development of marine fish larvae. Special attention is paid to investigations of transcriptomic patterns during postembryonic development and to the impact of environmental or nutritional factors on the transcriptome of marine fish larvae. Transcriptomic approaches will be especially useful in the future for investigating the effect of temperature and water acidification (or pH) on the development of different fish species in the context of global climate change.</dc:description>
