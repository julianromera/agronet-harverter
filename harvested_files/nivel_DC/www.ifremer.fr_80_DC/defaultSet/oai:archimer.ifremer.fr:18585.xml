  <dc:description>Quantification of mRNA of genes related to metabolism, immunity and cellular stress was examined in relation to a massive mortality event during the culture of American oyster larvae, Crassostrea virginica which was probably, in regard to previous microbiological analysis, induced by vibrio infection. To document molecular changes associated with the mortality event, mRNA levels were compared to biochemical and physiological data, previously described in a companion paper. Among the 18 genes studied, comparatively to the antibiotic control, 10 showed a lower relative gene expression when the massive mortality occurred. Six of them are presumed to be related to metabolism, corroborating the metabolic depression associated with the mortality event suggested by biochemical and physiological analyses. Relationships between the regulation of antioxidant enzyme activities, lipid peroxidation, and the mRNA abundance of genes linked to oxidative stress, cytoprotection, and immune response are also discussed. Finally, we observed an increase in the transcript abundance of two genes involved in apoptosis and cell regulation simultaneously with mortality, suggesting that these processes might be linked.</dc:description>
