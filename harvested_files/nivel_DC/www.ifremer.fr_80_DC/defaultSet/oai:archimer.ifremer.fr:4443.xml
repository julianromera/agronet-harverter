  <dc:title>Intensive larval culture of Macrobrachium rosenbergii : a cost study</dc:title>
  <dc:creator>AQUACOP</dc:creator>
  <dc:description>Pilot scale larval culture of Macrobrachium rosenbergii began in Tahiti at the end of 1976. Since then, four batches of postlarvae (2.3 millions) have been produced. Operating expenses cost was $13-35/thousands postlarvae. Based on the results obtained from the pilot program, we can project the cost of a commercial scale hatchery producing 10 million postlarvae/ year at $12/1,000. This includes construction and equipment costs. Due to the high cost of living in Tahiti, this figure would undoubtedly be lower in many other regions. [NOT CONTROLLED OCR]</dc:description>
